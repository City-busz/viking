In order to activate reference documentation, you have to specify
the following configure command line:
$ ./configure --enable-gtk-doc --enable-gtk-doc-html

Then, cd to doc/reference and launch make command.

(This directory is not recursively make when launching make from top
directory. So, this avoid spending time in reference documentation
computation when not really needed.)
