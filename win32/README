Files of this directory are probably not needed anymore (just use the regular makefile),
but are left as reference for the old compile method on Windows ;)

However the installer directory is used for the named purpose.
Instructions on how to use the installer will follow in due course (probably on the Wiki first).

----
If your GTK path isn't c:\gtk and/or your mingw path isn't c:\mingw, you will have to edit the scripts to compile.
Then run

setpath
makeall
link
