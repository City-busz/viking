
The build under Windows follows the same process as the traditional Linux build:

    cd ../src
    sh configure <options>
    make

There is a separate installer method using NSIS to generate the viking-1.X.Y.Z.exe installer file.

To generate the installer (once the code has been compiled as above) run the installer.bat
